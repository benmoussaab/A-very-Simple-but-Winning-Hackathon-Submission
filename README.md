# A-very-Simple-but-Winning-Hackathon-Submission


This repository contains the winning solution from the last DATASPACE intern hackathon, where we developed a predictive model for survival status based on key tumor features. The model leverages logistic-reg alongside robust data preprocessing and feature engineering to achieve top performance in the competition.

we tried more complex models but this was the best one
